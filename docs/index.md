-----------
The [db](https://github.com/ULHPC/pupper-db) puppet module has been designed to meta-module to manage {my,postgre}sql databases in a generic and homogeneous way

This is the main page of the documentation for this Puppet module, which is hosted and managed by [Read the Docs](http://db.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
It proposes to detail the following elements:

* An [Overview](overview.md) of the module is proposed, describing the puppet classes and/or definitions it implements.
     - you might also wish to check the `tests/` directory for sample test cases
* How to [test this module with Vagrant](vagrant.md)
* How to [contribute](contributing/index.md) to this puppet module development. In particular, we detail:
     - the [directory tree structure](contributing/layout.md)
	 - the steps to follow to [setup this repository](contributing/setup.md)
	 - information as regard the [semantic versioning](contributing/versioning.md) of this Puppet module.
     - Apart form the directory layout, we will cover various configuration aspects ([git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow), [RVM](https://rvm.io/), [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) etc.)
* Details on the [Read the Docs](http://ulhpc-puppet-db.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) management.
